        "title":"What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
        "description":"An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in authentication systems to grant and manage user access to resources and services. They are typically used in the context of web applications and APIs. An access token is a credential that is issued to a user after successful authentication. It represents the user's authorization to access specific resources or perform certain actions on behalf of the user. Access tokens are usually short-lived and have an expiration time. They are included in each request made by the client to the server, typically in the Authorization header or as a query parameter. The server validates the access token and grants or denies access to the requested resource based on its validity and the permissions associated with it. A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is also issued to a user during the authentication process. Its purpose is to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to reauthenticate. When an access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the server. This process is known as token refresh or token renewal. Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan compared to access tokens, but they should be kept secure since they can be used to obtain new access tokens. On the client-side, it is crucial to store these tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access. Storing them in a client-side cookie or local storage is not recommended due to security risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Instead, the preferred approach is to use an HTTP-only cookie to store the access token. This type of cookie is not accessible from client-side JavaScript, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks. The refresh token, being a more sensitive credential, should ideally be stored in a secure and encrypted manner, such as an HTTP-only cookie with the 'Secure' and 'SameSite' attributes set, or in a secure token storage mechanism provided by the platform or framework being used. By storing the access token securely and managing the refresh token properly, the client can maintain a secure and seamless user experience while interacting with protected resources or services provided by the server."

        "title":"What is express js? What is Nest JS?",
        "description":"Express.js and Nest.js are both popular web application frameworks based on Node.js. Here's an overview of each: Express.js: Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a lightweight and unopinionated approach to building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, and middleware integration. It offers a straightforward and intuitive API for creating server-side applications. Express.js is known for its simplicity and extensibility. It allows developers to quickly set up routes, handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and integrate middleware for tasks like request parsing, authentication, and error handling. Express.js doesn't enforce any specific application structure, giving developers the freedom to organize their code as they prefer. It has a vast ecosystem of middleware and plugins available, making it easy to extend and customize functionalities. Nest.js: Nest.js is a progressive, opinionated, and TypeScript-based web application framework built on top of Express.js. It provides an additional layer of abstraction and a structured architecture for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. Nest.js follows the architectural principles of modularity, dependency injection, and decorators to promote code organization and reusability. Nest.js is designed to be highly adaptable and supports various programming paradigms like object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming (FP), and reactive programming. It encourages the use of TypeScript, which adds static typing and additional tooling support, enhancing the developer experience and reducing errors. Nest.js provides a powerful dependency injection (DI) system that facilitates modular development, testing, and code decoupling. One of the distinguishing features of Nest.js is its support for creating enterprise-grade applications. It offers built-in support for features like module encapsulation, middleware pipelines, exception filters, guards for route authorization, and interceptors for request/response manipulation. It also provides out-of-the-box integrations with popular libraries and frameworks like TypeORM and GraphQL. Overall, while Express.js focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and customization, Nest.js builds upon Express.js to provide a structured, scalable, and enterprise-ready framework with enhanced development practices and TypeScript support. The choice between Express.js and Nest.js depends on the project requirements, complexity, team preferences, and the need for a structured architectural approach."

        "title":"Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?",
        "description":"SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems that serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a comparison between the two: Data Model: SQL databases follow a structured data model known as a relational model. Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, and relationships between tables are defined through foreign keys. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, have a flexible and schema-less data model. They can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graph-based structures. Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, which means they are designed to handle increasing workloads by adding more resources to a single server (e.g., CPU, memory). NoSQL databases, in contrast, are often horizontally scalable. They can handle high traffic and large amounts of data by distributing the load across multiple servers, allowing for easier scaling. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides a powerful and standardized way to query and manipulate relational data. NoSQL databases, however, have diverse query languages depending on the type of database. For example, document-oriented databases often use JSON-based query languages, while graph databases use graph query languages like Cypher. Schema Flexibility: SQL databases enforce rigid schemas where data must adhere to predefined structures. Altering the schema typically requires modifying the table structure and can be cumbersome. NoSQL databases provide greater schema flexibility since they don't enforce fixed schemas. Data can be added or modified without strict adherence to a predefined structure, making it easier to accommodate evolving data requirements. Transaction Support: SQL databases have strong transaction support with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. They ensure data integrity and reliability, making them suitable for applications that require strict consistency. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, often prioritize scalability and performance over strict consistency. They might offer eventual consistency, where data changes are propagated asynchronously, allowing for higher throughput and availability. Use Cases: SQL databases are commonly used for applications that require complex querying, transactional integrity, and structured data, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and traditional relational applications. NoSQL databases excel in scenarios involving large-scale data, real-time analytics, high-speed data ingestion, and situations where flexible schemas and horizontal scalability are essential. They are often preferred for applications like social networks, content management systems, IoT data storage, and log analytics. It's important to note that the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on specific project requirements, data characteristics, scalability needs, and the nature of the application being developed. Both types have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's common to see hybrid architectures where SQL and NoSQL databases are combined to leverage the benefits of each for different parts of an application."

        "title":"What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?",
        "description":"In MongoDB, the aggregate framework is a powerful feature that allows you to perform advanced data analysis and transformation operations on collections of documents. It provides a flexible and efficient way to process data, perform calculations, and generate aggregated results. The aggregate framework in MongoDB operates on the concept of a pipeline, where you can define a sequence of stages to process documents. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data and passes the modified documents to the next stage. The stages in the aggregate pipeline can perform a wide range of operations, including filtering, sorting, grouping, projecting, joining, and computing aggregate values. Some commonly used stages include: $match: Filters documents based on specified criteria, similar to the find operation. $group: Groups documents together based on a specific field or set of fields and allows for performing calculations and aggregations on grouped data. $project: Specifies which fields to include or exclude from the result documents and allows for renaming or adding new fields. $sort: Sorts the documents based on specified fields. $limit and $skip: Control the number of documents returned or skip a specified number of documents. $unwind: Deconstructs an array field from the input documents and produces a separate document for each array element. You can combine multiple stages in the aggregate pipeline to perform complex data transformations and computations. The output of the last stage in the pipeline is the result of the aggregation operation, which can be further processed, returned to the client, or stored in a collection. The aggregate framework is highly flexible and provides a rich set of operators and expressions that can be used within stages to manipulate and transform data. It allows for performing various mathematical calculations, string operations, date manipulations, and conditional operations. By leveraging the aggregate framework, you can efficiently perform tasks such as generating reports, computing statistical summaries, extracting specific information from documents, and performing complex data analytics on MongoDB collections. Overall, MongoDB's aggregate framework is a powerful tool for performing data analysis and manipulation on collections of documents. It offers a flexible pipeline-based approach to define stages and operations, allowing you to transform and aggregate data in a way that meets your specific requirements."
